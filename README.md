# RetroPage
This is the source code for RetroPage, which is a simple homepage made by Retroity with a bunch of links to various sites. No ads, no Google Analytics, no invasive scripts, and made to be as lightweight as possible. This is designed to be my own version of [StartHere](https://starthere.neocities.org/) by the Network Neighborhood group on Neocities.

This uses the experimental [element](https://github.com/neocities/element) by Neocities.
