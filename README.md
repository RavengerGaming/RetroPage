# RetroPage
This is the source code for RetroPage, which is a simple homepage made by Retroity with a bunch of links to various sites. No ads, no Google Analytics, no invasive scripts, lightweight. This is designed to be my own version of [StartHere](https://starthere.neocities.org/) by the Network Neighborhood group on Neocities. This uses the experimental [element](https://github.com/neocities/element) by Neocities.
