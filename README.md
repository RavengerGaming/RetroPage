# RetroPage
This is the source code for RetroPage, which is a simple homepage with a bunch of links to various sites. No ads, no Google Analytics, no invasive scripts, and made to be as lightweight as possible.

This uses the experimental [element](https://github.com/neocities/element) by Neocities.
