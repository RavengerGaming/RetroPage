# RetroPage
This is the source code for RetroPage, which is a simple, yet customizable startpage. No ads, no Google Analytics, no tracking, and very lightweight. This was originally designed to be a spiritual successor to the now-abandoned [StartHere](https://starthere.neocities.org/), which was made by the now-defunct Network Neighborhood group on Neocities. RetroPage uses the experimental [element](https://github.com/neocities/element) CSS framework.
