This is the source code for RetroPage, which is a simple homepage made by Retroity with search and links to various sites that are commonly used. No ads, no Google Analytics, no tracking, and very lightweight. This is designed to be a spiritual successor to the now-abandoned [StartHere](https://starthere.neocities.org/) by the now-defunct Network Neighborhood group on Neocities. RetroPage uses the experimental [element](https://github.com/neocities/element) CSS framework by Neocities.
